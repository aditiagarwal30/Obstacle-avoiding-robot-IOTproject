# Obstacle-avoiding-robot-IOTproject

We proposed a robot that avoids the obstacle which comes in its path this robot is introduced because in many of the industries we have seen that many heavy components which they have to move for one place to another place which is not possible without the help of machines. With this we got idea and we introduce the robot named as Obstacle avoidance robot using Arduino. Obstacle avoidance robot is design to allow robot to navigate in unknown environment by avoiding collisions. Obstacle avoiding robot senses obstacles in the path, avoids it and resumes its running.We have make use of sensors to achieve this objective. We have used two D.C.MOTORS i.e battery operated motors. The reason behind using BO motors is it consumes less power supply and can work properly on 9 volt battery. The construction of the robot circuit is easy and small. The main component behind this robot is ATmega328p microcontroller which is a brain of this robot. The idea proposed in this paper is by using machine vision to guide the robot. The field of machine vision has growing at a fast pace. Machine vision applications can be divided into four types from a technical point of view. They can be used to locate, measure, inspect and identify. The robot proposed in this paper is guided with the help of machine vision. The best part of our project is that if any obstacle is encountered by the robot the robot automatically stops.
